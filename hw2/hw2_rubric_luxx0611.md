### Comments

We had updated the HW2 pdf on Canvas shortly after releasing. It looks like you were using an outdated version which formatted the output for Problem B slightly differently. Please make sure to check Canvas in case changes like this are made in the future.

### Problem C(10/20 pts)

Deductions : #5, #6

- By nesting functions and calling an inner function in an outer function, you are essentially utilizing a loop. 
- Poor coding style also extends to this as functions should never be nested within another. 
- Because you defined **3** functions, there should be 3 templates, 1 for each function
